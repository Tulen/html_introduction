      <li> Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots
           and a pinch of salt and pepper; stir to coat. Stir in vinegar, reduce heat
           to medium-low, and cook until vinegar is evaporated, 3-4 minutes.
           Reduce heat to low and continue cooking shallots, stirring frequently, until tender and translucent,
           about 5 minutes longer. Transfer shallot reduction to a small bowl and let cool completely. </li>
      <li> Meanwhile, fill a blender with hot water to warm it; set aside. Melt remaining 1 cup butter
           in a small saucepan over medium heat until butter is foamy. Transfer butter to a measuring cup. </li>
      <li> Drain blender and dry well. Combine egg yolks, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon water in
           warm, dry blender. PureÃÅe mixture until smooth. Remove lid insert. With blender
           running, slowly pour in hot butter in a thin stream of droplets, discarding milk solids at
           bottom of measuring cup. </li>
      <li> Pour sauce into a medium bowl. Stir in shallot reduction and tarragon and season to taste
           with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired. </li>
    </ol>
